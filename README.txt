still under way...
constructing chat (and hopefully +video later) app, using socket io + MERN + redux (+webRTC)
as a learning tool of using socket io and web RTC (and practice the others)

learnt chat part from JavaScript Mastery (youtube channel)(ZwFA3YMfkoc) 
and video part from (if it finally get added to the app) JavaScript Mastery (oxFr7we3LC8) and Web Dev Simplified (youtube channel) (DvlyzDZDEq4)
But there will be significant different this time (e.g. JSM chat app store chat in a rather simplistic way; JSM video call app didn't use room)
And of coz the documnets from the package/library, the starting guides are quite good
